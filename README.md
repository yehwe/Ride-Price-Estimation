### Ride Price Estimation System 
### Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning system to estimate ride prices based on trip and contextual features.

The objective is to simulate a real-world machine learning workflow, including dataset design, data preprocessing, regression modeling, classification modeling, and ethical analysis.

### Dataset Description

The dataset was synthetically generated and contains 250 rows.

Target Variable:

ride_price (Continuous)

Features Used:

distance_km

duration_min

time_of_day

traffic_level

weather

demand_level

vehicle_type

The dataset includes both numerical and categorical variables.
### Feature Justification

Distance and duration directly impact operational cost.

Demand level and weather simulate surge pricing.

Vehicle type reflects service tier differences.

Traffic level and time of day model contextual pricing variations.

Excluded Feature:

driver_rating (excluded because it does not directly affect pricing in most systems).
### 1. Linear Regression

Used to predict continuous ride prices.

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 2. Logistic Regression

Used to classify rides as:

High-Cost

Low-Cost

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix
### Key Findings

Distance is the most influential feature in ride price prediction.

Premium vehicle selection significantly increases ride cost.

The regression model successfully captured pricing trends.

Classification model achieved strong accuracy in distinguishing high-cost rides.
### Ethical Considerations

Surge pricing may unintentionally disadvantage certain areas.

Model inaccuracies could cause unfair pricing.

Synthetic data limits real-world generalization.
